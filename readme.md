# Deodar Block Maker

Quick and dirty script to create base blocks for [Deodar](https://github.com/brockcataldi/deodar) because I was getting annoyed creating them manually.

## Create a Block

Media Text example block.

```
npm run make "Media Text"
```

## Installing as a Global Command

```
npm pack
```

```
npm install -g deodar-block-maker-1.0.0.tgz
```

To Run:
```
deodar-block-maker "example block"
```
